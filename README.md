## Link to Deployed Application

A link to the deployed application can be found here: https://annalisedev.github.io/passwordgenerator/Develop/  

## Description

This week's Challenge required modification of the starter code in order for the password generator to be functional. In order for this to be considered complete and functional the generator needed to prompt the user around the length of password as well as decisions on the characters to be used, for instance a decision on whether they want to include uppercase, lowercase, special symbols and numbers. 

The page is built leveraging HTML, CSS and Javascript. The HTML and CSS files were not altered. The main change in the javascript file was to bu8ild out the generatePassword function which was missing.
